# Life expectancy

Utilities for loading the `life_expectancy.xlsx` workbook and calculating residual life expectancy values for a given birthdate and gender using the 2023 table. The included grid renderer can turn the computed result into a payload for a UI grid or a simple ASCII display.

## Running the example

Use Python 3.11+ (no external dependencies required) and run the example script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will load `life_expectancy.xlsx`, compute a residual life expectancy for a sample birthdate, and print a small grid with the lookup results.
